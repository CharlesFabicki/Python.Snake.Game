# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. In this game, you control a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow while avoiding collisions with walls and itself.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Make sure you have Python and the Turtle graphics library installed.

3. Run the `snake_game.py` script using your Python interpreter.

4. Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, and Right) to control the snake's direction.

5. Your goal is to eat the randomly generated food items to increase your score.

6. Avoid hitting the walls or running into the snake's own body, as this will end the game.

## Rules

- The snake starts as a small circle on the screen.
- Eating a food item makes the snake grow longer and faster.
- The game keeps track of your current score and best score.
- When the snake hits a wall or itself, the game ends, and your score is reset.

## Features

- Randomly generated food items with different shapes and colors.
- Snake segments that grow in size as you eat food.
- Score display showing your current score and best score.
- A "Game Over" message when you collide with a wall or the snake's body.

## Controls

- Up Arrow: Move the snake up
- Down Arrow: Move the snake down
- Left Arrow: Move the snake left
- Right Arrow: Move the snake right

## Customization

You can customize the game by modifying various parameters in the script, such as the screen size, snake speed, and the appearance of food items.
